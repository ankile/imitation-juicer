# JUICER: Data-Efficient Imitation Learning for Robotic Assembly

## Installation Instructions


### Install Conda

First, install Conda by following the instructions on the [Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (here using Miniconda).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

After installing, initialize your newly-installed Miniconda. The following commands initialize for bash and zsh shells:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
```

To activate the changes, restart your shell or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Create a Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment by running:

```bash
conda create -n imitation-juicer python=3.8 -y
```

Activate the environment by running:

```bash
conda activate imitation-juicer
```

Once installed and activated, make some compatibility changes to the environment by running:

```bash
pip install setuptools==65.5.0
pip install --upgrade pip wheel==0.38.4
pip install termcolor
```


### Install IsaacGym

Download the IsaacGym installer from the [IsaacGym website](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and follow the instructions to download the package by running (also refer to the [FurnitureBench installlation instructions](https://clvrai.github.io/furniture-bench/docs/getting_started/installing_furniture_sim.html#download-isaac-gym)):

- Click "Join now" and log into your NVIDIA account.
- Click "Member area".
- Read and check the box for the license agreement.
- Download and unzip `Isaac Gym - Ubuntu Linux 18.04 / 20.04 Preview 4 release`.

Once the zipped file is downloaded, move it to the desired location and unzip it by running:

```bash
tar -xzf IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz
```


Now, you can install the IsaacGym package by navigating to the `isaacgym` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -e python --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall
```

_Note: The `--no-cache-dir` and `--force-reinstall` flags are used to avoid potential issues with the installation that we encountered._

_Note: Please ignore Pip's notice that `[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip` as the current version of Pip is necessary for compatibility with the codebase._

_Tip: The documentation for IsaacGym  is located inside the `docs` directory in the unzipped folder and is not available online. You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to access the documentation._

You can now safely delete the downloaded zipped file and navigate back to the root directory for your project. 


### Install FurnitureBench

To allow for data collection with the SpaceMouse, etc. we used a [custom fork](https://github.com/ankile/furniture-bench/tree/iros-2024-release-v1) of the [FurnitureBench code](https://github.com/clvrai/furniture-bench). The fork is included in this codebase as a submodule. To install the FurnitureBench package, first run:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ankile/imitation-juicer.git
```

_Note: If you forgot to clone the submodule, you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodule._

Then, install the FurnitureBench package by running:

```bash
cd imitation-juicer/furniture-bench
pip install -e .
```

To test the installation of FurnitureBench, run:

```bash
python -m furniture_bench.scripts.run_sim_env --furniture one_leg --scripted
```

This should open a window with the simulated environment and the robot in it.

If you encounter the error `ImportError: libpython3.8.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` this might be remedied by adding the conda environment's library path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This can be done by, e.g., running:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=YOUR_CONDA_PATH/envs/YOUR_CONDA_ENV_NAME/lib
```

### Install the ImitationJuicer Package

Finally, install the ImitationJuicer package by running:

```bash
cd ..
pip install -e .
```

### Data Collection: Install the SpaceMouse Driver

To make data collection with the SpaceMouse possible, you need to install the SpaceMouse driver: 

```bash
sudo apt install libspnav-dev spacenavd
```

Then, the SpaceMouse driver needs to run in the background. To start the driver, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl start spacenavd
```


### Install Additional Dependencies

Depending on what parts of the codebase you want to run, you may need to install additional dependencies. Especially different vision encoders might require additional dependencies. To install the R3M or VIP encoder, respectively, run:

```bash
pip install -e imitation-juicer/furniture-bench/r3m
pip install -e imitation-juicer/furniture-bench/vip
```

The Spatial Softmax encoder and BC_RNN policy requires the `robomimic` package to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robomimic.git
cd robomimic
pip install -e .
```


## Download the Data

We provide a Google Drive folder that contains a zip file with the raw data and a zip file with the processed data. [Download the data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13UqtMLXY1_8JCQOZf3j-YbZyMRTsgZ2K?usp=sharing).

The data files can be unzipped by running:

```bash
tar -xzvf imitation-juicer-data-raw.tar.gz
tar -xzvf imitation-juicer-data-processed.tar.gz
```

Then, for the code to know where to look for the data, please set the environment variables `DATA_DIR_RAW` and `DATA_DIR_PROCESSED` to the paths of the raw and processed data directories, respectively. This can be done by running or adding the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export DATA_DIR_RAW=/path/to/raw-data
export DATA_DIR_PROCESSED=/path/to/processed-data
```

In the above example the folders contained in the twro zipped files, `raw` and `processed`, should be placed immediately inside the above folder, e.g., `/path/to/raw-data/raw` and `/path/to/processed-data/processed`.

All parts of the code (data collection, training, evaluation rollout storage, data processing, etc.) uise these environment variables to locate the data.

_Note: The code uses the directory structure in the folders to locate the data. If you change the directory structure, you may need to update the code accordingly._



## Guide to Project Workflow

This README outlines the workflow for collecting demonstrations,
annotating them, augmenting trajectories, training models, and
evaluating the trained models. Below are the steps involved in the
process.

The below instructions assume that the user has set environment variables for the raw data directory (`DATA_DIR_RAW`) and the processed data directory (`DATA_DIR_PROCESSED`). The raw data directory contains the raw demonstration data as one `.pkl` (possibly `.pkl.xz` if compressed, which is handled automatically) file per trajectory, while the processed data directory contain `.zarr` files with the processed data ready for training with multiple trajectories for each dataset. 

### Collect Demonstrations

To collect data, start by invoking the simulated environment. Input
actions are recorded using the 3DConnextion SpaceMouse. The source code
and command line arguments are available in
`src/data_collection/teleop.py`. An example command for collecting
demonstrations for the `one_leg` task is:

```bash
python -m src.data_collection.teleop --furniture one_leg --pkl-only --num-demos 10 --randomness low [--save-failure --no-ee-laser]
```

Demonstrations are saved as `.pkl` files at:
```bash
$DATA_DIR_RAW/raw/sim/one_leg/teleop/low/success/
```

By default, only successful demonstrations are stored. Failures can be
stored by using the `--save-failure` flag. The `--no-ee-laser` flag
disables the assistive red light.

To collect data, control the robot with the SpaceMouse. To store an
episode and reset the environment, press `t`. To discard an episode,
press `n`. To \"undo\" actions, press `b`. To toggle recording on and
off, use `c` and `p`, respectively.

### Annotate Demonstrations

Before trajectory augmentation, demos must be annotated at bottleneck
states. Use `src/data_collection/annotate_demo.py` for this purpose.
Here\'s how to invoke the tool:
```bash
python -m src.data_collection.annotate_demo --furniture one_leg --rest-of-arguments-tbd
```

Use `k` and `j` to navigate frames, and `l` and `h` for faster
navigation. Press `space` to mark a frame and `u` to undo a mark. Press
`s` to save and move to the next trajectory.

### Augment Trajectories

After annotation, use `src/data_collection/backward_augment.py` to
generate counterfactual snippets. Example command:

```bash
python -m src.data_collection.backward_augment --furniture one_leg --randomness low --demo-source teleop [--no-filter-pickles]
```

New demonstrations are stored at:

```bash
$DATA_DIR_RAW/raw/sim/one_leg/augmentation/low/success/
```

### Train Models

Train models using `src/train/bc.py`. We use Hydra and OmegaConf for
hyperparameter management. Ensure WandB authentication before starting.

To train for the `one_leg` task:

```bash
python -m src.train.bc +experiment=image_baseline furniture=one_leg
```

For a debug run, add `dryrun=true`. For rollouts during training, add
`rollout=rollout`.

### Evaluate Models

Evaluate trained models with `src/eval/evaluate_model.py`. For example:

```bash
python -m src.eval.evaluate_model --run-id entity/project/run-id --furniture one_leg --n-envs 10 --n-rollouts 10 --randomness low [--save-rollouts --wandb --if-exists append --run-state finished]
```

To save rollout results, use `--save-rollouts`. For WandB logging, add
`--wandb`.
